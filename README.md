## Experiment
### Aim
Let users debug the Game of Life in three different languages(Fortran, Go and Rust). Based on their debugging, determine which language is faster to comprehend.

### Steps for the end-users, who use our platform to participate in our study:
 * Get a token from the Course administrator.
 * Access our platform and fill in the form to answer pre-screening questions.
 * A link to raw code is displayed, copy it and paste it to the recommended online compiler.
 * Once done debugging, the participant can return the token to course administrator.

### Privacy of participants' data:
 * The participant's data will not have their PII information.
 * If the participant chooses to get their record deleted, they can request so to the course administrator.
 * The participant agrees to answer the pre-screening questions.
