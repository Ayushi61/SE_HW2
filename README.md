## Instructions

Steps to follow:

1. Get the token and application link from admin, who coordinates with you during HW3 session.
2. Enter your token.
3. You are directed to a questionairre which has the following questions, where all of them will require you to select an option from 1 to 5:
  *  How well do you understand Game of life? I understand what is happening. Rate on from 1 to 5, 5 being you understand it completely.
  *  If asked to code from scratch, rate from 1 to 5 how comformtable will you be in doing that, 5 being you can code it sleeping.
  *  How familiar are you with the rules of game of life? Rate from 1 to 5, 5 being you know all the rules.
  *  Let us know of your programming skills by rating them from 1 to 5, 5 being you are a pro.
  *  How long have you been coding? Rate from 1 to 5, 1 means 1+ years, 2 means 2+ years and so on.
  *  Rate your programming experience with GoLang from 1 to 5, 5 being pro.
  *  Rate your programming experience with Rust from 1 to 5, 5 being pro.
  *  Rate your programming experience with Fortran from 1 to 5, 5 being pro.
 Note: A user must answer all the questions to move forward.
4. Submit your choices to above questions.
5. Next, you are presented with three sections, each one for the languages: GoLang, Rust, Fortran.
6. Each section points to online editor and compiler link where you can paste the code displayed.
7. Clicking `Start` will start your debugging time and clicking `Stop` will complete your debugging session in that language. Kindly, get your results verified before clicking `Stop`.
8. Complete all sections and you will be redirected to home page back.
9. Mail your token to the course TA.

## Experiment
### Aim
Let users debug the Game of Life in three different languages(Fortran, Go and Rust). Based on their debugging, determine which language is faster to comprehend.

### Steps for the end-users, who use our platform to participate in our study:
 * Get a token from the Course administrator.
 * Access our platform and fill in the form to answer pre-screening questions.
 * A link to raw code is displayed, copy it and paste it to the recommended online compiler.
 * Once done debugging, the participant can return the token to course administrator.

### Privacy of participants' data:
 * The participant's data will not have their PII information.
 * If the participant chooses to get their record deleted, they can request so to the course administrator.
 * The participant agrees to answer the pre-screening questions.
 * The participant can exercise following rights:
   * Right to be anonymous.
   * Right to refuse to participate.
   * Right to be forgotten from the records of the study.
